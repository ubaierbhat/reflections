When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	I would like to have a remote repository if I am collaborating with may other people on the 
	same project. I will also like to keep a remote repository as a on-line backup of my work 
	which I will be able to access and share with other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Hmm.. it might be because the changes on the GitHub are not yet ready to be integrated with
	any changes that I have on the local repository.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A fork is a clone/copy of someone else's GitHub repository in another GitHub repository. A clone is 
	a copy of a remote (e.g. GitHub) repository on a local device. A branch is a different version of a
	a repository. A fork is used when you want to use make changes to someone else's GitHub project when
	you are not the collaborator. The clone is used if you want to copy the GitHub project to a local 
	repository. A branch is used if you want to make some changes to your project e.g. experiment with some 
	features while keeping the original project separate (until you decide to merge the two)
