When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would like to have a remote repository if I am collaborating with may other people on the 
  same project. I will also like to keep a remote repository as a on-line backup of my work 
  which I will be able to access and share with other.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Hmm.. it might be because the changes on the GitHub are not yet ready to be integrated with
  any changes that I have on the local repository.
