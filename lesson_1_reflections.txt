How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	There were fewer lines of code to look at after using diff which helped to find
	the bug faster

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It will help me to experiment with my code a make changes without worrying about
	backups and manually creating multiple copies

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Manually control is good but you have to be very active and make sure you
	commit at the right time. Google doc is good for rich text documents but 
	we cannot use it for any programming

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes multiple files are dependent on each other and will not work
	if the versions are different

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log is used to view history of all commits and git diff is used to compare
	two different files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    We can go back to a version and trace the bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
